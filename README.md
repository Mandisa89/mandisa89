## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Mandisa. I have been working in the fast-paced, vibrant South African film industry as a freelance cameraperson since 2015 and have been teaching myself to program since 2020. 

I graduated from AFDA with a BA Honours in Cinematography, and my decade of experience in the visual medium of film has translated to a natural love for front-end development - including design, user experience and accessibility. The power of Javascript and the satisfaction of refining a logical thought iteration through iteration, instead of having the perfect solution from the get-go, is something I have come to deeply appreciate on my learning journey.

- ðŸ’§ Iâ€™m currently working on a website about natural pools and the filtering power of wetlands! You can check out its progress [here](https://github.com/Mandisa89/Bootcamp/tree/master/Submissions%20L2T06_Capstone%20IV%20Amanzi%20Wethu/website)!
- ðŸ“š Iâ€™m currently learning more about frameworks and improving my tech stack through self-study on Udemy and edX.
- ðŸŒŸ I am looking to gain more experience in collaborating on programming more challenging real-world projects for clients, building on the limited experience I have already accrued building client websites on platforms such as Wix ([see link here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mandisa-macleod/details/featured/)) that are easily maintainable by themselves once the build is completed.
